Privacy Policy — Moodverse

Last updated: October 5, 2025

Moodverse (“the App”) is provided by Yalcinkaya Systems (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we do—and don’t do—with your data.

1) What we collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from you on our servers.
The App runs fully on your device.

2) Photos, camera, and media

Photos (Library access): Used only to let you pick an image for your card and to save the image you create back to your gallery.

Camera (optional): Used only if you choose to take a photo for your card.
All processing happens on-device. We do not upload your images anywhere.

3) Device data & analytics

We do not use analytics, advertising SDKs, tracking, or crash reporting that collects personal data.

We do not create profiles, and we do not sell or share any data.

4) Third-party services

The App is built with Expo/React Native and standard mobile operating system APIs. These tools operate on-device and, in our configuration, do not receive your personal data from us.

5) Children’s privacy

Moodverse is a general-audience app. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

6) Your choices

You can revoke photo/camera permissions at any time in your device settings.

Uninstalling the App removes the App and its local data from your device (except images you saved to your gallery).

7) Data security

Because we do not maintain user accounts or remote servers for your content, your creations remain on your device unless you choose to share them.

8) Changes to this policy

We may update this Policy to reflect product or legal changes. The “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly. Material changes will be highlighted in the App update notes when appropriate.

9) Contact us

If you have questions about this Policy or the App, contact: digiarzuhal@gmail.com

Summary: Moodverse doesn’t collect or upload your data. Photos and creations stay on your device unless you share them.
